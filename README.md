# master-chef

Code used to host a website that allows me to store recipes from other websites in one central place. 
It uses ChatGPT to convert recipes to a JSON object which I store in a private repo. 
I read the contents off a webpage containing a recipe, ask chatgpt to convert this for me, and allow myself to edit 
the contents of the recipe. I can also feed it text directly, or add a recipe completely manually, though I have not used
these options yet. 

The HTML and CSS for the pages is also almost entirely generated using ChatGPT.
